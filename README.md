# Light-Intensity-For-Germination
The researcher has used light intensity (as treatment with 3 different levels: 5W, 10W, 15W) for measure germination potential how they are significantly differing.  
He has measured different responses. Such as, 
Seedling length (Root and Shoot separately)
Germination percentage (with dark control group)
